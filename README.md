### **Security**
#### **GitLeaks**

We use Gitleaks for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens
To start using, please execute next command:

```bash
make install_hooks
```

To avoid OS inconsistencies, we use Docker. Please ensure it is installed on your local machine, otherwise the installation will fail.

Once installed, GitLeaks will automatically check your repository for secrets on every commit.
If any leaks are detected, a report will be generated at: `gitleaks-report.json`. This file is added to `.gitignore`

Please resolve any issues before committing and try again.
The configuration file can be found at: `scripts/githooks/`
